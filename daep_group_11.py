"""Looking at the correlation heatmap, we can observe the following:

income_classified shows a positive correlation with education-num, age, capital-gain, and hours-per-week. This suggests that individuals with higher education, older age, higher capital gains, and more hours worked per week are more likely to have an income greater than 50K.
education-num has a strong negative correlation with work_hours_efficiency. This is expected, as work_hours_efficiency is calculated by dividing hours-per-week by education-num. Higher education-num values will naturally lead to lower work_hours_efficiency if hours-per-week is constant.
age and work_experience_approx are highly correlated, which is also expected as work_experience_approx is derived from age and education-num.
Overall, the correlation analysis provides insights into which numerical variables have the strongest linear relationships with each other and with the target variable (income_classified).

Summary of Income, Age Group, and Education Level Analysis:

The analysis of income in relation to age groups and education levels reveals strong and interconnected trends. The proportion of individuals earning over 50K generally increases with age, peaking in the 36-65 age range. Simultaneously, there is a clear and significant positive correlation between education level and the likelihood of higher income; individuals with advanced degrees (Doctorate, Prof-school, Masters) are substantially more likely to earn over 50K compared to those with lower educational attainment. The heatmap combining these factors highlights that while higher education is a strong predictor of higher income, this effect is most pronounced in the prime working-age groups (36-65). Even with higher education, younger individuals (17-25) have a much lower proportion of high earners, suggesting that accumulated work experience plays a crucial role. Conversely, individuals with low education levels have minimal chances of earning over 50K, regardless of age. These findings underscore the combined importance of both educational attainment and career progression (often correlated with age) in achieving higher income brackets.

--- Summary of Work Hours Analysis ---

The analysis of work hours reveals several key patterns and relationships. The distribution of 'hours-per-week' is right-skewed, with a strong peak at 40 hours per week, representing standard full-time employment, but also a long tail extending towards higher work hours.

The relationship between income and work hours is significant: individuals working longer hours are considerably more likely to earn over 50K. Specifically, the proportion of higher earners increases steadily with the 'work_hours_group', with the '51+' and '41-50' hour groups showing the highest likelihood of earning >50K, far surpassing the standard '31-40' hour group and part-time groups.

Average work hours vary notably across different work classes and occupations. Work classes like 'Self-emp-inc' and 'Self-emp-not-inc' tend to have higher average work hours than 'Private' or 'Local-gov'. Among occupations, 'Farming-fishing' and 'Transport-moving' show higher average hours, while 'Other-service' and 'Priv-house-serv' show lower averages.

The 'work_hours_efficiency' variable, calculated as hours per week divided by education number, provides an interesting perspective. Its distribution is highly right-skewed. Counter-intuitively, individuals earning >50K have a slightly lower average work hours efficiency than those earning <=50K. This is primarily explained by the strong negative correlation between education level and work hours efficiency: individuals with higher education levels tend to have lower efficiency scores due to the calculation method, even if they work similar hours. This highlights that while longer hours are associated with higher income, educational attainment plays a significant role in 'efficiency' as defined here, and both factors interact to influence income.

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   The tuned LightGBM model achieved perfect performance on the test set with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC all reported as 1.0000.
*   The confusion matrix for the tuned model showed no misclassifications.
*   Feature importance analysis of the tuned LightGBM model identified 'age', 'income\_classified' (the target variable), 'work\_hours\_efficiency', 'capital-gain', and 'hours-per-week' as the top 5 most important features for predicting income.

### Insights or Next Steps

*   The perfect performance of the tuned LightGBM model strongly suggests potential data leakage in the dataset or analysis process. Further investigation is required to identify and resolve this issue before trusting the model's predictions.
*   The high importance of the target variable 'income\_classified' in the feature importance analysis reinforces the suspicion of data leakage and highlights the need to re-evaluate the features used for training.

Summary of Income, Age Group, and Education Level Analysis:

The analysis of income in relation to age groups and education levels reveals strong and interconnected trends. The proportion of individuals earning over 50K generally increases with age, peaking in the 36-65 age range. Simultaneously, there is a clear and significant positive correlation between education level and the likelihood of higher income; individuals with advanced degrees (Doctorate, Prof-school, Masters) are substantially more likely to earn over 50K compared to those with lower educational attainment. The heatmap combining these factors highlights that while higher education is a strong predictor of higher income, this effect is most pronounced in the prime working-age groups (36-65). Even with higher education, younger individuals (17-25) have a much lower proportion of high earners, suggesting that accumulated work experience plays a crucial role. Conversely, individuals with low education levels have minimal chances of earning over 50K, regardless of age. These findings underscore the combined importance of both educational attainment and career progression (often correlated with age) in achieving higher income brackets.

The analysis of income by marital status reveals a strong relationship between these two factors.

--- Summary of Work Hours Analysis ---

The analysis of work hours reveals several key patterns and relationships. The distribution of 'hours-per-week' is right-skewed, with a strong peak at 40 hours per week, representing standard full-time employment, but also a long tail extending towards higher work hours.

The relationship between income and work hours is significant: individuals working longer hours are considerably more likely to earn over 50K. Specifically, the proportion of higher earners increases steadily with the 'work_hours_group', with the '51+' and '41-50' hour groups showing the highest likelihood of earning >50K, far surpassing the standard '31-40' hour group and part-time groups.

Average work hours vary notably across different work classes and occupations. Work classes like 'Self-emp-inc' and 'Self-emp-not-inc' tend to have higher average work hours than 'Private' or 'Local-gov'. Among occupations, 'Farming-fishing' and 'Transport-moving' show higher average hours, while 'Other-service' and 'Priv-house-serv' show lower averages.

The 'work_hours_efficiency' variable, calculated as hours per week divided by education number, provides an interesting perspective. Its distribution is highly right-skewed. Counter-intuitively, individuals earning >50K have a slightly lower average work hours efficiency than those earning <=50K. This is primarily explained by the strong negative correlation between education level and work hours efficiency: individuals with higher education levels tend to have lower efficiency scores due to the calculation method, even if they work similar hours. This highlights that while longer hours are associated with higher income, educational attainment plays a significant role in 'efficiency' as defined here, and both factors interact to influence income.

"""## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   The distribution of 'hours-per-week' is right-skewed, with a peak at 40 hours per week, indicating standard full-time employment.
*   Individuals working longer hours are more likely to earn over \$50K. The '51+' hours group and the '41-50' hours group show the highest proportions of individuals earning over \$50K (over 40% and over 39% respectively), significantly higher than the '31-40' hour group (~20%).
*   Average work hours vary by work class and occupation. 'Self-emp-inc' and 'Self-emp-not-inc' work classes have higher average hours than 'Private' or 'Local-gov'. 'Farming-fishing' and 'Transport-moving' occupations show higher average hours, while 'Other-service' and 'Priv-house-serv' show lower averages.
*   The 'work\_hours\_efficiency' (hours per week / education number) is right-skewed. Individuals earning <= \$50K have a slightly higher average 'work\_hours\_efficiency' (around 4.5) compared to those earning >\$50K (around 4.1).
*   There is a strong negative correlation between education level and 'work\_hours\_efficiency', with lower education levels having significantly higher average efficiency scores.

### Insights or Next Steps

*   The counter-intuitive finding regarding 'work\_hours\_efficiency' and income suggests that higher education levels, despite potentially leading to higher income, decrease this specific efficiency metric. Further analysis could explore alternative definitions of efficiency or model the interaction between hours, education, and income more directly.
*   Given the strong influence of work class and occupation on average work hours, future analysis could investigate if the relationship between work hours and income varies significantly across these groups.

*   The analysis highlights racial disparities in income distribution within this dataset. Further investigation into potential contributing factors like education level, occupation, and work hours within each racial group could provide deeper insights.
*   Exploring whether these income disparities persist when controlling for other demographic or socioeconomic variables would be a valuable next step.
